##Next Steps


    Interacting with Litecoin: The LitecoinClient used in this script is a placeholder. You should replace it with an actual Litecoin client or library, such as pycoind or bitcoinlib, that can send transactions to the Litecoin network.

    Transaction Broadcasting: In the send_transaction method, replace the simulation code with actual interaction with a Litecoin node (e.g., using RPC or a Litecoin wallet service).
