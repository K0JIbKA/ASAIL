Sure! Below is an example of the **`ltc_swap.py`** file, which is responsible for handling Litecoin (LTC) atomic swaps using **Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)**. This example will cover the process of creating an HTLC, which can be used for an atomic swap.

### Example: `ltc_swap.py` (Litecoin HTLC)

```python
import hashlib
import time
from pycoind import LitecoinClient  # Pycoin library or other Litecoin libraries for interacting with Litecoin

class LitecoinHTLC:
    def __init__(self, private_key, recipient_address, secret, locktime):
        self.private_key = private_key
        self.recipient_address = recipient_address
        self.secret = secret
        self.locktime = locktime  # UNIX timestamp
        self.secret_hash = self.hash_secret(secret)

    def hash_secret(self, secret):
        """
        Hashes the secret using SHA-256.
        """
        return hashlib.sha256(secret.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

    def create_htlc(self):
        """
        Creates an HTLC transaction for Litecoin.
        """
        # Construct the HTLC transaction details
        htlc_transaction = {
            'recipient': self.recipient_address,
            'secret_hash': self.secret_hash,
            'locktime': self.locktime,
            'sender_private_key': self.private_key
        }

        # Simulate creating an HTLC
        # In practice, this would use Litecoin libraries to create the actual transaction.
        # This could involve a contract with time locks and conditions.
        print(f"Creating HTLC for Litecoin swap...\nRecipient: {self.recipient_address}\nSecret Hash: {self.secret_hash}\nLocktime: {self.locktime}")
        
        return htlc_transaction

    def sign_transaction(self, htlc_transaction):
        """
        Sign the transaction with the sender's private key.
        """
        print("Signing the transaction with the sender's private key...")
        
        # Here, you would use Litecoin's signing functions
        # Simulating the signing process
        signed_transaction = f"Signed transaction: {htlc_transaction}"
        return signed_transaction

    def send_transaction(self, signed_transaction):
        """
        Broadcast the transaction to the Litecoin network.
        """
        # In practice, this would use a Litecoin client library to send the transaction
        print(f"Sending signed transaction to the Litecoin network: {signed_transaction}")
        
        # Simulating sending the transaction
        # You'd interact with the Litecoin node here
        response = {"status": "success", "txid": "dummy_txid"}
        return response

    def verify_swap(self, txid):
        """
        Verifies that the swap has been completed successfully on the Litecoin network.
        """
        # In practice, you'd check the transaction ID to verify the status of the swap.
        print(f"Verifying swap completion for txid: {txid}")
        
        # Simulating verification
        return {"status": "confirmed", "txid": txid}

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example values
    sender_private_key = "your_private_key_here"  # Replace with actual private key
    recipient_ltc_address = "recipient_litecoin_address_here"  # Replace with actual recipient address
    secret = "secret_passphrase"  # The secret to be shared between the swap participants
    locktime = int(time.time()) + 3600  # Locktime: 1 hour from now

    # Create the Litecoin HTLC instance
    ltc_htlc = LitecoinHTLC(sender_private_key, recipient_ltc_address, secret, locktime)
    
    # Create the HTLC transaction
    htlc_transaction = ltc_htlc.create_htlc()
    
    # Sign the transaction
    signed_transaction = ltc_htlc.sign_transaction(htlc_transaction)
    
    # Send the transaction to the Litecoin network
    tx_response = ltc_htlc.send_transaction(signed_transaction)
    print(f"Transaction sent. Response: {tx_response}")
    
    # Verify the swap
    txid = tx_response.get("txid")
    swap_verification = ltc_htlc.verify_swap(txid)
    print(f"Swap verification result: {swap_verification}")
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Imports**:

   * `hashlib`: Used to create the SHA-256 hash of the secret that will be used in the HTLC.
   * `time`: Used to set the locktime for the transaction (in UNIX timestamp format).
   * `LitecoinClient`: This is a placeholder for the actual Litecoin client you would use to interact with the Litecoin blockchain. You can use libraries like `pycoind` or `bitcoinlib` to interact with Litecoin nodes.

2. **LitecoinHTLC Class**:

   * **`__init__`**: Initializes the class with the sender’s private key, recipient’s address, secret, and locktime. It also calculates the hash of the secret.
   * **`hash_secret`**: A helper function that hashes the secret using SHA-256.
   * **`create_htlc`**: Creates the HTLC transaction by preparing the details like the recipient's address, secret hash, and locktime.
   * **`sign_transaction`**: Signs the HTLC transaction using the sender's private key.
   * **`send_transaction`**: Simulates broadcasting the signed transaction to the Litecoin network. In practice, this would use a Litecoin library to send the transaction.
   * **`verify_swap`**: Verifies the swap’s completion by checking the transaction ID (`txid`). This would involve querying the Litecoin network to confirm the transaction status.

3. **Example Usage**:

   * An example scenario is provided where a swap is created with the sender's private key, recipient's Litecoin address, a secret (that will be revealed after the swap), and a locktime set to 1 hour from the current time.
   * It simulates creating the HTLC, signing it, sending it to the network, and verifying the transaction status.

### Required Libraries

To interact with the Litecoin blockchain, you’ll need to install some Python libraries. Here's an example using the **pycoind** library, but feel free to substitute it with another Litecoin library that suits your needs.

```bash
pip install pycoind
```

---

### Next Steps

* **Interacting with Litecoin**: The `LitecoinClient` used in this script is a placeholder. You should replace it with an actual Litecoin client or library, such as `pycoind` or `bitcoinlib`, that can send transactions to the Litecoin network.

* **Transaction Broadcasting**: In the `send_transaction` method, replace the simulation code with actual interaction with a Litecoin node (e.g., using RPC or a Litecoin wallet service).
